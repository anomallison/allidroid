An effervescent,
An angry,
A writhing
A slimy,
A pulsating
A ghostly,
A vile,
A goopy,
A sticky,
A fangorious,
A confused,
A ghastly,
A flying
A skittering
A wandering
A drunken,
An awkward looking
A slightly perturbed
A rather silly looking
A cheerful looking
A minty-fresh
A confused looking
A sharp looking
A phosphorescent
An enthusiastic
A vicious,
A bloodied
A bubbly
A stalking
A gelatinous,
A scaley,
