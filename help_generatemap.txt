``!generatemap`` generates a low resolution hex grid terrain map

``!generatemap`` takes upto 5 arguments currently: the width, the height, grid opacity, the number of landmasses to generate on the map, the cold balance between 0 and 100 typically, and the hot balance between 0 and 100 typically

hot and cold balance are by default set to 50 without specification

example
``!generatemap 40 30 0 8 50 50``
``!generatemap 150 100 0.33 15``
``!generatemap 32 18 0.5``
