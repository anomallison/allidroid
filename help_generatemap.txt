``!generatemap`` generates a low resolution hex grid terrain map

``!generatemap`` accepts various arguments:
``-w X`` sets the width to X
``-h X`` sets the height to X
``-g X`` sets the grid opacity to X (default 0)
``-l X`` sets the landmasses to X (default is calculated: Math.ceil(Math.log2(Map_Size)*Math.log2(Map_Size)/2), Map_Size is height * width)
``-hot X`` sets the hot balance to X (default hot 25 cold 25, for reference)
``-cold X`` sets the cold balance to X
``-nocities`` the map will not place any cities (or by extension, any towns or roads)
``-notowns`` the map will not place any towns
``-roads`` the map will place roads between cities and towns (greatly increases render time)

example
``!generatemap 40 30 0 8 50 50``
``!generatemap 150 100 0.33 15``
``!generatemap 32 18 0.5``
