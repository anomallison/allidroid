[
	"a tenfold voice, assembled in a patchwork of stolen cries & speeches",
	"her natural crown, which rises in ten intertwined spurs of bone from the skull",
	"a sacred sword, now broken, with a terrible destiny awaiting it",
	"her left hand which heals, & her right hand which brings death",
	"the visions from god she receives in ecstatic, weeping fits",
	"her instinctive command of all wild beasts & serpents",
	"the chains with which she binds the spirits of the world",
	"those parts of her which were removed & have been replaced by marvellous artifices",
	"the severed, still-living heads of the kings she has deposed",
	"her royal sceptre & the monstrous shadows cast by its light",
	"the gilded bones of her sisters & rivals",
	"an army of suffering ghosts, her victims, that haunt a step behind her",
	"a blade of rainbows which reaches to the limit of the eye",
	"the living things that wilt & wither under her feet",
	"her burning & radioactive presence",
	"the pacts she has made with demons & other things deep beneath the earth",
	"her inhuman & incomprehensible lineage",
	"the wealth of a fallen empire which she wears as jewellery",
	"the contagious insanity of her gaze",
	"an indestructible writ of authority & ownership over the world"
