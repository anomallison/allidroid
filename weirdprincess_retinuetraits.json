	"their wicked depravity & endless cruelty",
	"the jugs of enchanted alcohol they carry",
	"their rotting black fingers, covered in expensive rings",
	"the lances they hold, covered in grotesque pennants",
	"their maimed & missing limbs",
	"their unshakeable, worshipful loyalty",
	"the light that condenses & changes colour around them",
	"their berserk rages",
	"their crowns of flame",
	"their vivid colours & the bright clothing they wear",
	"the exotic steeds they ride",
	"the oversized & bloody blades they carry",
	"the screaming slaves they drive before them",
	"how they devour the bodies of their foes",
	"the light of the black sun running through their veins",
	"the huge train of skulls they pull behind them",
	"the smell of incense & rot that precedes them",
	"their hidden faces which are never seen",
	"their lips coated in salt",
	"the one eye they share between them all"
