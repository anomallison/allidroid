that're flailing their limbs wildly
that're covered in razor sharp spines
that're covered in ambergris
that're covered in feathers
that're punching demons into gibblets
that're eating well cooked bacon
that're feasting on human flesh
with flesh rotting from their bones
with sharp tentacles flailing from their bodies
that're on fire
that're downing a 6 pack each
that're offering poutine
that're swinging swords poorly
that're swinging spears proficiently
that're throwing rocks wildly
that's eyes are all dart around suspiciously
that're covered in chattering mouths gnashing their teeth
that're wearing VR headsets
that're wearing high visability vests
that're wearing exactly what you'd expect
that're wearing, I dunno, stuff
that're covered in... ew...
that're chewing on bones
with arrows protruding from them
with fungi growing over them
that're wearing crowns of flowers
that're wearing bowler hats
that're all wearing two monocles a piece
that're wearing monocles
that're spinning pocket watches carelessly
that're staring into nothingness
that are totally being like that
that're sneaking around, poorly
that're humming their own theme music
that're carrying a large sack of unknown contents
that're all wearing big sheriff's badges
that're wearing lanyards
that're wearing fake moustaches
that're brandishing their mother's credit cards
that're brandishing ornate looking daggers
that're juggling fancy looking axes
that're wearing awfully ratty cloaks
that're eating a birthday cake with their fists
